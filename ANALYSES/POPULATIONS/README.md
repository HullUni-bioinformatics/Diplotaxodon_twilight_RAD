###SNP ananlyses using populations from the Stacks program suite

The program `populations` from the `Stacks` program suite is used to filter SNP datasets as well as to infer basic population genomics metrics, e.g. Fst, FIS, etc. 

Populations was run both with all 4 populations at the same time as well as for all possible population pairings to calculate pairwise Fst and identify putative candidate outlier loci - see respective directories.

The various output formats produced by populations were used as starting point for further analyses with additional software (Bayenv, Bayescan, RaXML, R).
